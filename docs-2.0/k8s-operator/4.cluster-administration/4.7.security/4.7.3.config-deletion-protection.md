# Configure deletion protection

NebulaGraph Operator supports deletion protection to prevent NebulaGraph clusters from being deleted by accident. This topic describes how to configure deletion protection for a NebulaGraph cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A NebulaGraph cluster is created with NebulaGrpah Operator. For more information, see [Create a NebulaGraph cluster](../4.1.installation/4.1.1.cluster-install.md).
- Admission control is enabled on the NebulaGraph cluster. For more information, see [Enable admission control](4.7.2.enable-admission-control.md).

## Add an annotation to enable deletion protection

Add the `delete-protection` annotation to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl annotate nc nebula -n nebula-test nebula-graph.io/delete-protection=true
```
The preceding command enables deletion protection for the `nebula` cluster in the `nebula-test` namespace.


## Verify deletion protection

To verify that deletion protection is enabled, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete nc nebula -n nebula-test
```

The preceding command attempts to delete the `nebula` cluster in the `nebula-test` namespace.

Output:

```bash
Error from server: admission webhook "nebulaclustervalidating.nebula-graph.io" denied the request: metadata.annotations[nebula-graph.io/delete-protection]: Forbidden: protected cluster cannot be deleted
```

## Remove the annotation to disable deletion protection

Remove the `delete-protection` annotation from the cluster as follows:

```bash
kubectl annotate nc nebula -n nebula-test nebula-graph.io/delete-protection-
```

The preceding command disables deletion protection for the `nebula` cluster in the `nebula-test` namespace.
