# Overview of backup and restore in a K8s environment

NebulaGraph Operator supports backup and restore operations on the {{nebula.name}} cluster in a K8s environment.

## Principle introduction

When backing up data, NebulaGraph Operator maps each backup operation to a NebulaBackup instance through a custom `NebulaBackup` or `NebulaCronBackup` resource object. `NebulaBackup` is used to perform one-time backup jobs, and `NebulaCronBackup` is used to manage scheduled backup jobs. `NebulaCronBackup` manages several `NebulaBackup` instances. These resource objects encapsulate the use of [{{br_ent.name}}](../../../backup-and-restore/nebula-br-ent/1.br-ent-overview.md) and start backup tasks to perform backup operations.

When restoring data, NebulaGraph Operator checks whether the specified backup {{nebula.name}} cluster exists, whether access to remote storage is normal, and then creates a new cluster and restores the backup data to the newly created {{nebula.name}} cluster based on the information defined in the custom `NebulaRestore` resource object. For more information, see [Restore process diagram](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator/blob/v{{operator.release}}/doc/user/br_guide.md#restore-nebulagraph-cluster).
